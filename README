LaBoGrid is both a Java library and an executable software. Source code is
managed with Maven (see http://maven.apache.org/). It includes Java classes,
bash scripts (used to execute LaBoGrid) and LaTeX sources of the user's guide.
LaBoGrid's distribution archives and JAR file can be produced by calling
'mvn package'. There are 2 distribution archives: a "sources" archive
(containing whole maven project), a "binaries" archive (allowing users to
directly use LaBoGrid -- in addition to the software, this archive contains
samples and the user's guide). LaBoGrid's API documentation is generated using
'mvn javadoc:javadoc'.
