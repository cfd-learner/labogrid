1. Introduction

LaBoGrid is a fluid flow simulation tool based on Lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods
and oriented towards experimentation (simulation capabilities are easily
extendable). It is especially focused on the efficient execution in
heterogeneous (regarding installed software, architecture, computational power,
etc.) and unreliable distributed environments. However, LaBoGrid can
efficiently be executed in more common environments such as homogeneous clusters
or simply desktop computers.

This file is about how LaBoGrid can be executed on a single
computer or a cluster.

Users only searching for a quick start may directly jump to Section 3.

More details about LaBoGrid's usage are available in user's guide located in
"doc" folder.

LaBoGrid is build on top of DiMaWo framework. LaBoGrid was initially developed
at University of Liege, Belgium, in the frame of a collaboration between
Algorithmics and Chemical engineering laboratories. It is based on research
described in following thesises:

2. Directory's content

In this section, the content of this directory is explained. Provided script
files are described.

This directory contains 3 sub-directory ("bin", "doc" and "samples") as
well as 1 file: this "read me".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 bin

This directory contains scripts that help for the execution of LaBoGrid
simulations and LaBoGrid's "binaries".
"bin" contains all required data in order to use LaBoGrid. It is therefore
independent and can safely be copied or moved at another location.

Two examples of usage of the content of this directory are given in Section 3.

More details are available in "bin"'s README file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4 doc

This directory contains the  user's guide (PDF file) which explains the way
LaBoGrid can be used and extended in order to execute advanced flow simulations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5 samples

This directory contains sample input files that can be used in order to execute
LaBoGrid simulations. See Section 3 for more details.

================================================================================
3. Quick start

In this section, we show how the same simulation can be executed in 2 different
environments (a single computer and a cluster). The simulation consists of a
Lattice Boltzmann flow using a 3D lattice of size (44,44,44). Only 10 iterations
are executed in order to keep execution time low. This simulation is described
in 2 configuration files available in "samples" directory. These 2 files only
differ regarding the location of the associated XML schema file and
the way simulation input files and output files are respectively provided and
retrieved. "samples" also contains a solid file (MU44.mat.gz) representing the
structure the fluid flows through.

In the two cases, the state of the flow is retrieved at the end of the
simulation. In order to be post-processed, output files may be converted into
readable text files. The conversion process is described in last sub-section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Running sample simulation locally

a. Open a terminal and change directory to base directory.

b. Copy sample LaBoGrid configuration file into "bin" directory with
following command:

                    cp samples/conf-local.xml bin/conf.xml

The configuration file is renamed in order to comply with default script
parameters.

c. Change current directory to "bin".

d. Execute the simulation described in conf.xml file with LaBoGrid by executing
following command:

                         ./runLocalSim.sh conf.xml

e. If all went well, 2 additional directories were created: "out" and
"work_dir". "work_dir" contains log files about the execution of the simulation.
More details about these log files can found in user's guide. "out" contains
the result of the simulation. This result can be used to resume the simulation
or to be post-processed. In latter case, output should be converted into a
readable format (see Section 3.3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Running sample simulation on a cluster

3.2.1 Pre-requisites

The deployment of LaBoGrid in a distributed environment like a cluster is more
difficult than simply executing it on a single computer. In this section, some
pre-requisites are briefly adressed.

Processes executing a LaBoGrid simualtion are called "workers".
There is one worker per computer. The first worker to be executed is called
"bootstrap worker".

In order to provide input files to/retrieve output files from workers, a
"stand alone server" process is executed on a computer.
Input files must be available on this computer and output
files are available on it after simulation's execution.

The computers that will execute the workers must be accessible through SSH
and firewalls configured such as the same TCP port is open for LaBoGrid on
each computer. It is advised to use an SSH-agent to handle the numerous
connections performed for the execution of LaBoGrid.

In the following, we consider that deployment scripts are executed from a
computer with host name "ail3". The stand alone server is also executed on
this computer and listens to port 50200. Workers are deployed on 4 computers:
"candi01", "candi02", "candi03" and "candi04". "candi01" will execute the
bootstrap worker. TCP port 50200 is open on each of these 4 computers.

3.2.2 The simulation

a. Open a terminal and change directory to base directory.

b. Copy sample LaBoGrid configuration file into "bin" directory with
following command:

                    cp samples/conf-distributed.xml bin/conf.xml

The configuration file is renamed in order to comply with default script
parameters.

c. Change current directory to "bin".

d. Edit "config-cluster.sh" file and update variables if necessary. It is likely
that you will have to update the computer executing bootstrap worker
(BOOTSTRAP_COMP) and the list of computers running the other workers
(CLUSTER). Note that computers may be identified only by their host name or by
a pair (user name, host name) using following notation:

                                     user@host

where user is the user name to use for connexion and host the host name.

e. Edit "config-labogrid.sh" file and update variables if necessary. You may
have to update the host name of the computer running the stand alone server
(SA_HOST) and the TCP port the server is listening to (SA_PORT), as well as
the TCP port LaBoGrid workers can listen to (WORK_PORT). Be sure that all given
ports are open on associated computers.

f. Open another terminal with the same current directory.

g. In the new terminal, run the stand alone server using following command:

                     ./startStandAloneServer.sh ail3 50200 out/

"ail3" is the host name of the computer running the stand alone server and
50200 the TCP port the server is listening to. Update these values in function
of what you wrote in "config-labogrid.sh". "out" is the name of the directory
where output files will be stored; this value can remain unchanged.

h. Return to other terminal and start an SSH agent (in order to avoid to have to
type password on every SSH connection). If you do not know how to do this,
search for "ssh agent" on the Internet, tutorials are available aplenty.

i. Install LaBoGrid and configuration files onto cluster computers by executing
following command:

                                  ./installAndCopy.sh

j. Start all workers and wait the end of the simulation by executing following
command:

                               ./startWorkersAndWait.sh

k. If all went well, 2 additional directories were created: "out" and
"ssh-log". "ssh-log" contains log files about the execution of SSH processes.
"out" contains the result of the simulation. This result can be used to resume
the simulation or to be post-processed. In latter case, output should be
converted into a readable format (see Section 3.3).

l. Stop stand alone server by interrupting the process running in second
terminal (use for example Ctrl-C shortkey).

m. Clean cluster computers i.e. remove LaBoGrid, configuration files and log
files:

                              ./killClearAndUninstall.sh

Warning about no java processes killed can safely be ignored. It is the expected
result of above command because workers end their execution on their own.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 Converting output of simulations

In both examples above, the result of the simulation is stored into "out"
sub-directory of "bin" directory. The output files consist of files with "state"
extension, containing the state of the flow, and a "mGraph.dat" file describing
the way simulation's state is distributed among "state" files.

The output files are generally not directly usable by another tool than
LaBoGrid. Therefore, the way to convert these files into a more readable format
is described in this section.

a. Open a terminal and change directory to "bin" directory.

b. Execute following command:

                          ./convertOutput.sh out/ res XY 10

First argument is the directory containing the output files to convert. Second
argument is the prefix of the directory that will contain converted data.
Third argument specifies that XY slices of the lattice are produced per file
(other possible values are XZ and YZ) resulting from the conversion. Last
argument gives the iteration reached by the simulation (state files are named
using following scheme: x_y.state where x is a natural number and y the
last iteration reached by the simulation).

c. If all went well, an additional sub-directory was created: "res_10". This
directory contains one file per slice of the lattice. For more details about
produced files, see user's guide.

================================================================================
4. Troubleshooting

For some reasons, problems may arise while executing LaBoGrid. While local
executions, like the one described in Section 3.1, should not cause a lot of
trouble, the distributed case of Section 3.2 is far more complex and
error-prone.

Most problems encountered come from an improper configuration of firewalls on
cluster computers and stand alone server computer. Be sure that all required
TCP ports are open on each computer.

Another typical problem (that may arise with local simulations too) is a "wrong"
configuration file making references to unknown classes or that cannot be
validated by the associated schema. In this case, check your configuration file.

The validation problem can come from the fact that the schema file is not
accessible. Be sure that the configuration file
does refer to it in the right way, either using an absolute path (which can be
a URL) or a relative path; in this case, the path must be relative to the
location of the configuration file. In the context of a distributed simulation,
the schema file is always copied in the same directory as configuration file.

In local case, above problems cause error messages to be displayed in the
console. In distributed case, they can be diagnosed using log files containing
the output of SSH processes executing the workers. These files are available
by default in "ssh-log" sub-directory of "bin".

For more subtle problems, finer grained log information may be required.
In local case, the logs in "work_dir" subdirectory of "bin" may contain
interesting messages. In particular, the file "*_DecentralLBController.log"
should be read. In distributed case, these log files are available on computers
executing the workers. "downloadLogs.sh" script downloads them locally in order
to ease access to them.
