LaBoGrid is a tool that allows to execute fluid flow simulations based on
Lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods in a distributed way.
<p>
LaBoGrid is the result
of a collaboration between the <a href="http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/">
Montefiore Institut</a> and the
<a href="http://www.chimapp.ulg.ac.be/fichiers/LGC/LGC_presenta.html">
Chemical Engineering Laboratory</a> of University of Liege. It is based on
work described in the PhD thesises of Djomice A. Beugre and Gerard Dethier:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Djomice A. Beugre, <i>Etude de l'ecoulement d'un fluide dans
	des geometries complexes rencontrees en Genie Chimique par la methode de
	Boltzmann sur reseau</i>, 2010.
	<li>Gerard Dethier, <i>Design and Implementation of a Distributed Lattice
	Boltzmann-based Fluid Flow Simulation Tool</i>, 2011.
</ul>

<p>A deep understanding of the code presented in this documentation is
hard to reach if the 2 above thesises have not been read and
well understood.</p>

<p>The thesis of Djomice Beugre describes the theory related to the LB 
methods, in particular the simulation of 3D fluid flows using D3Q19 lattices
and various collision operators.
LB methods are implemented by classes of package {@link
be.ulg.montefiore.laboGrid.lb}.</p>

<p>Gerard Dethier's work addresses the efficient and yet portable implementation
of LB methods in a distributed environment. In particular, Dynamic
Heterogeneous Clusters (DHCs) are targeted. These clusters are made of
computers that may not share same architecture, computational power, etc.
In addition, these computers may not be reliable. LaBoGrid is therefore
composed of a "middleware" part (in addition to the "simulation" part) handling
problems like load-balancing, fault-tolerance, etc.</p>

<p>LaBoGrid's middleware is based on a Master/Worker architecture.
However, this part has been implemented in 2 different ways:
first in a fully centralized way then in a moslty decentralized way.
The reasons for this second implementation is better scalability
(almost suppressed bottleneck) and enhanced robustness (no more
single point of failure). These two implementations are based on the
DiMaWo framework (developed by Gerard Dethier in the context of his
PhD thesis). However, only the second one uses the full potential of the DiMaWo
framework.</p>

<p>DiMaWo framework eases the development of distributed applications based
on the Master/Worker architecture. The framework provides services
(broadcasting, leader election, etc.) that are implemented in a mostly
decentralized way. These services are common to many distributed applications.</p>

<p>In order to write a DiMaWo application, a developper must subclass
the ControllerAgent class (implementing the leader) and the Task class
(implementing a worker). In addition, the developper
should provide a class implementing the TaskFactory interface (used
by core DiMaWo components). LaBoGrid provides 3 such factories:
{@link be.ulg.montefiore.laboGrid.CentralLBTaskFactory CentralLBTaskFactory},
{@link be.ulg.montefiore.laboGrid.CentralLBTaskFactory DecentralLBTaskFactory} and
{@link be.ulg.montefiore.laboGrid.CentralLBTaskFactory NicFactory}.
The 2 first factories provide respectively centralized and
mostly decentralized implementation of LaBoGrid. The last is adapted
to <a href="http://www.ulg.ac.be/cms/c_228508/le-serveur-de-calcul-parallele-clustervision-nic3">
University of Liege's supercomputer NIC3</a>.</p>

<p>The DiMaWo framework provides <i>launchers</i> that can be used
to execute a "process" of the distributed application. These launchers
take a TaskFactory class name as argument and use reflection to instantiate
the referenced TaskFactory. One of LaBoGrid's 3 implementations is therefore
easy to deploy: just provide one of the factories to a launcher.</p>
