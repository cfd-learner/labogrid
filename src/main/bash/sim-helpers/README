Summary

================================================================================
1. Introduction

This file describes the scripts provided with LaBoGrid that ease its usage.

. common-lib.sh: This file defines functions that may be used by other scripts.

. config-cluster.sh: This file defines variables describing the cluster used to
execute LaBoGrid. These variables include names for directories created on
cluster machines for LaBoGrid's binaries, logs and temporary files, as well as
the host names of computers that should execute LaBoGrid's processes.

. config-labogrid.sh: This file defines variables directly related to LaBoGrid:
the ports used by workers and stand alone server, stand alone server's host
name, the files to use as input (configuration file and optional power model
file, see user's guide), LaBoGrid's factory class name (see user's guide),
LaBoGrid JAR and XML schema files, verbosity level, MN-tree parameters and SSH
log directory.

. convertOutput.sh: This script can be executed to convert simulation result
files into a more accessible format (see user's guide).

. copyToCluster.sh: Copies configuration and input files to cluster.

. downloadLogs.sh: Downloads logs generated by LaBoGrid's agents executed by
cluster's computers.

. installAndCopy.sh: Installs LaBoGrid and copies
configuration and input files on cluster's computers.

. killClearAndCopy.sh: Kills all LaBoGrid processes, clears working directory
and copies new configuration and input files to cluster computers.

. killClearAndUninstall.sh: Kills all LaBoGrid processes, clears working
directory and removes LaBoGrid from cluster computers.

. killWorkers.sh: Kills all LaBoGrid processes on cluster computers.

. runLocalSim.sh: Executes simulations described by a given configuration file
on local computer.

. setPermissions.sh: This script is used to restore proper execution flags on 
some scripts of this folder.

. startStandAloneServer.sh: Executes a stand alone server on this computer.

. startWorkers.sh: Triggers the execution of workers on cluster's computers.

. startWorkersAndWait.sh: Triggers the execution of workers on cluster's
computers and waits for the end of the execution of all workers.
