	<section name="Introduction">
		
		<p>LaBoGrid is a fluid flow simulation tool based on Lattice Boltzmann
		(LB) methods and oriented towards experimentation (simulation
		capabilities are easily extendable). It is especially focused on the
		efficient execution in heterogeneous (regarding installed software,
		architecture, computational power, etc.) and unreliable distributed
		environments. However, LaBoGrid can efficiently be executed in more
		common environments such as homogeneous clusters or simply desktop
		computers.</p>
		
		<p>LaBoGrid is build on top of <a href="http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~dethier/dimawo/">DiMaWo</a> framework. LaBoGrid was initially
		developed at University of Liege, Belgium, in the frame of a
		collaboration between Algorithmics (now defunct) and <a href="http://www.chimapp.ulg.ac.be/">Chemical
		engineering</a> laboratories. It is based on research described in
		following thesises:</p>
